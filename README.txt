Hello! I'm Quinn Liu, a rising Junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science, with minors in Math and Design. I would personally love to work on projects that are an intersection between these fields in almost any industry.
Outside of school, I enjoy exploring my surroundings, playing and watching soccer, as well as producing and DJing.
Enjoy!
